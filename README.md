## Setup

## Working on your assigment

- Check which ones are failing and adjust the code in `src/<name-exercise>-exercises.js`, i.e. `src/javascript-recap-exercises.js`
- Whenever you finish working on your assignment or want to commit some changes, just commit directly to master and then push the code:
  - `git commit -am 'your commit message'`
  - `git push origin master`

## After the assignment
- When you finished the assignment please check the feedback branch. You can find it in the `Pull requests` tab and verify that all tests have passed
